## Manu dung beetles
## Laura  Allen - 10/10/2020

## Key questions:
## 1) How does the alpha diversity profile change across disturbance gradient
## 2) How does species composition change (RDA) 
## 3) Does ratio of abundance of large: small beetles change?
## 4) does ratio of abundance of rollers:tunnellers change?
## 5) does the dispersal of small+medium seeds change along the gradient (large seeds = control?).

## other necessary points:
## veg pca to show disturbance
## morans i for spatial autocorrelation?

## NExt: start importing the analysis step by step to address the specific issues.
